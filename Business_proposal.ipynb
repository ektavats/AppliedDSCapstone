I am sure Stockholm attracts us all as a place to stay. This project targets the people migrating to Stockholm and aims at helping them in deciding a suitable neighborhood for them to live in, based on their preferences. The main criteria or services under consideration for comparing different neighborhoods include the housing prices, and the proximity to grocery stores and primary schools. Therefore, an interesting battle of neighborhoods will be presented in this project, with the final goal of choosing the best neighborhood to live based on the services desired."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To begin with, using wikipedia and geocoder, we will extract and visualize the information about the boroughs (stadsdelsomr\u00e5den) in the Stockholm City Centre.
